				Hey there! Thanks for visiting my page! Here you can find the latest information on me and my projects. Have a look around and please leave me a message on the contact page!
			</p>

				A little bit about myself: I graduated from Appalachian State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Arts and Imaging Technology. After working in the field for a few years I am starting to realize that printing is different than I expected. I need more opportunity for advancement and a greater sense of accomplishment. I have always had a strong interest in coding, however never really acted upon it. I took a web development class as part of my degree, which resurfaced my desire to code. After I realized I needed a change, I started exploring the web development again - trying to teach myself through <a target="blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">CodeCademy.com</a> which was going great but I wanted something more official on my resume which is when I stumbled upon this class. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I can not wait to finish and start my new career in web development!
